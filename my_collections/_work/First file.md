title: Key ratios for life insurance1
---

The purpose of this post is for me to easily find this document from International Association of Insurance Supervisors when I need it:  
<https://www.iaisweb.org/modules/cciais/assets/files/pdf/061002_ICP_12C__Life_Insurance_Financial_Analysis.pdf>.

Aim of the ratios is to draw conclusions about the current financial condition of the insurer, the likelihood of a sound financial future and the risks that may lead to problems.
It is important to say that it is essential to consider the differences in business mix, as well as that the ratios are indicative of insurers' condition rather than conclusive

1. *Business mix*  
2. Business in force + new - cancellation (they like to talk about premium all the time, as number of policies can also contain group policies)  
3. *New business* should be positive. The growth in new business income should exceed the rate of inflation. Ratio is (Premium_0-Premium_1)/Premium_0  
4. Lapse analysis - bezvredna - implies poor quality underwriting/sales. *Lapse ratio*: If there is nothing better, assume it all happened in the first year i Lapse/(NewPrem_0+NewPrem_-1)/2, or, more complicated: Lapse/(0.35NP_0+0.45NP_-1+0.2NP-2)  
5. *Proportion reinsured*: Premium ReIns/Premium Ins, might be issue if high  
6. *actual vs. expected* e.g. claims  
7. *Claims ratio*: C/L (?? maybe for term)  
8. *Expense ratio*: E/P  
9. *Investment revenue ratio*: Investment revenue/Premium, but better even: Investment revenue / (Assets_0+Assets_-1-Investment revenue)/2   
10. *Profit breakdown*:  
>- Investment income on retained earnings___12 
>- Planned profits (profit margin release)___3  
  >- Experienced profits_______________________5  
  >-    Mortality/morbidity____________________4  
  >-    Expenses______________________________(1)  
  >- Investment                               1  
  >- Adjustments                             1  
  >- Gross profit                                          20  
  >- Tax                                                      (6)  
  >- Net profit                                              14  

11. *Proportion of inadmissible assets* (2-10pc is ok) + assets  
12. *Currency and duration matching* (The **claims** are projected for each year, based on current valuation assumptions, and compared with the expected available assete in those years.)  
13. *Solvency ratio*.   

To be noted: **Financial condition report** which should contain  
>- The nature of the business, including countries of operation, separation of insurance funds, classes of business and products, and performance by growth and market share  
>- The reinsurance program, including details and its suitability  
>- Data quality, including steps to verify its relevance, completeness, and accuracy  
>- Risks underwritten, including all policy guarantees and any contractual options  
>- Adequacy of premium rates relative to underwriting strategy  
>- Experience of all insurance risks (including lapses and surrenders), investment earnings and costs, acquisition expenses (including commissions), and administrative expenses  
>- Investment policy and its suitability and implementation  
>- Assets summary and mix, changes from prior year, and suitability to liabilities  
>- Valuation of liabilities, including methods, assumptions, and changes from previous year  
>- Profit or surplus, including analysis by source, movements and observed trends, distribution recommended for policy bonuses, dividends, and retained capital  
>- Solvency and capital adequacy, including the future needs shown by observed trends and or business plans and likely sources of capital.  

 

Note also:
IRIS system for early warnings, but each jurisdiction should develop their own. Much more used in non-life.
Stress tests, or sensitivity tests.
